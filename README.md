# GPT Fine-Tuning Demo

## Introduction
This repository demonstrates fine-tuning OpenAI’s GPT model on a custom dataset. Fine-tuning allows the model to adapt to specific use cases and improve performance on domain-specific tasks.

## Folder Structure
```
GPT-Fine-Tuning-Demo/
├── data/              # Store datasets used for fine-tuning
├── notebooks/         # Jupyter Notebooks
│   └── main.ipynb     # The primary notebook for GPT fine-tuning
├── README.md          # Documentation
└── requirements.txt   # Dependencies
```

## Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Access to OpenAI’s API key. Sign up at [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShabnamLabs/GPT-Fine-Tuning-Demo.git
   cd GPT-Fine-Tuning-Demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
   ```

## Fine-Tuning Steps
### Step 1: Prepare Dataset
- Add your dataset to the `data/src` folder.

### Step 2: Launch Notebook
- Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and open `main.ipynb`.
- Follow the steps to:
  1. Load the dataset.
  2. Preprocess the data.
  3. Upload and fine-tune the model.

### Step 3: Monitor Fine-Tuning
- Monitor the training progress using OpenAI’s API.

## Results
- Use the fine-tuned model for inference by specifying its ID in API requests.
